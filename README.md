## Description

My project is a README.md file generator that prompts users to answer questions about their project to create a README file directly on their  computer.

I created this project to eliminate several steps of creating a repository on Github and spend more time on my work.

My project solved the problem of the tedious work that comes with creating a README file. Now web developers can spend more time doing what they love.

## Installation

Node js and inquirer npm are required for this project.

## Usage 

Web developers can use this project daily to generate README files for their projects.
